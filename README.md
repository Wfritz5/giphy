giphy API

https://wfritz5.github.io/giphy/

In this project I used the Giphy API, Javascript, Jquery, HTML, CSS, and bootstrap

The user will search for a movie that the enjoy watching. 
The page will then search GIphy API to find 10 GIF's.. 
Be warned, there are filters within the code to make sure that only G, PG, PG-13 Gifs will appear.
